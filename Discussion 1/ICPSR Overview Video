ICPSR has a posted a recording of its February 2016 webinar to YouTube. Find the video, "Finding/Sharing Usable Research Data: An Orientation to ICPSR Services," at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIhzTjEdYpg.

If you have just 20 minutes, I suggest you fast-forward to 13 minutes 15 seconds in. Watch through 28:10, or a bit further, through 30:50.

Topics covered:
(13:15) The concept of data curation
Review of the study home page
Finding data: by search and browse 

(28:10) International data sets
Data sets for which online analysis is available (using SDA)
Replication data sets
