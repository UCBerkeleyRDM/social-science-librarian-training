3. A template readme file for researchers in the social sciences
A readme.txt file is a document that gives users important information about other files in a digital object or collection of objects. They are a form of documentation.
Georgia Tech readme: http://d7.library.gatech.edu/research-data/readme
Cornell’s RDM group has a terrific comprehensive guide to creating readme files: http://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme
A beginner’s guide to creating a readme: https://changelog.com/a-beginners-guide-to-creating-a-readme/


Notes
Create a file, upload it to figshare, get iframe, embed in Guide 
If data are sensitive, consider including that kind of information in a separate file

readme can serve as very lightweight documentation for datasets that don’t require a lot of explanatory additional text. Many people make a readme that contains all the variable names, etc. -- essentially a codebook. Our goal here is to keep the readme much more brief than that.
- file format and extension
- software used, and version
- PI contact information
- date/location of data collection
- method of collection
- licensing information

Other ideas: 
The ICPSR study homepage (example; UC Berkeley login required) includes a set of information about the study. The section headings -- Citation, Funding, Scope of Study, Variables, etc. -- can serve as a template for the readme document created by the researcher planning to deposit the data at ICPSR. More generally, a researcher might check with his or her intended repository to see what types of information it will require.
